# Hierarchical Dirichlet process to estimate disclosure risk

We propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process Gibbs sampler to estimate the disclure risk of dataset. This repository provide all the code to reproduce the results and eventually apply the algorithm to their own data.

Requirements:
- Pandas 2.2.1
- Numpy 1.26.4
- tensorflow 2.14.0
- tensorflow_probability 0.22.1
